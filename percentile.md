To tackle percentile questions on the GRE or GMAT, you'll need to understand a few key concepts and assumptions:

1. **Percentile Definition**: A percentile rank indicates the percentage of scores that fall below a given score. For example, if you’re in the 90th percentile, you scored better than 90% of the test-takers.

2. **Percentile and Raw Scores**: Percentiles are often used to describe how a score compares to others in a distribution. However, the actual percentile rank depends on the distribution of scores for that test.

3. **Cumulative Distribution**: To find a percentile rank, you need to know the cumulative distribution of scores. This is usually provided by test reports or score distribution charts.

4. **Interpreting Percentiles**: Higher percentiles mean better performance relative to others. For example, a score in the 95th percentile means you performed better than 95% of other test-takers.

5. **Percentile Ranges**: The GRE and GMAT often provide percentiles for specific score ranges. Understand that these percentiles can vary year-to-year based on the test-taker pool.

6. **Score vs. Percentile**: There’s often a score to percentile conversion chart available for the GRE and GMAT, showing how raw scores translate into percentiles.

7. **Estimation and Comparison**: Sometimes you may need to estimate or compare percentiles. This involves understanding how changes in score affect percentiles, which can be approached through approximation or using provided conversion tables.

To be effective with percentile math, practice interpreting and calculating percentiles using these rules and assumptions, and familiarize yourself with how they are used in the context of GRE and GMAT scores.

**Key Concept**
Percentiles in statistics.

**Key Concept Explanation**
A percentile is a measure used in statistics that indicates the relative standing of a value within a dataset. It shows the percentage of data points that fall below a particular value. For example, if a score is in the 80th percentile, it means that 80% of the data points are below this score. Percentiles help to understand the distribution of data, comparing individual scores against the dataset, and identifying outliers.

### Detailed Explanation of Percentiles:

1. **Percentile Calculation:**
   - To find the percentile rank of a score in a dataset, you need to sort the data in ascending order.
   - The formula to determine the position of a specific percentile (P) in a dataset with \( N \) values is:
     $`
     \text{Position} = P \times (N + 1)
     `$
   - For instance, to find the 80th percentile in a dataset with 300 values:
     $`
     \text{Position} = 0.80 \times (300 + 1) = 0.80 \times 301 = 240.8
     `$
   - Since the position is a decimal, you typically interpolate between the 240th and 241st values.

2. **Nature of Percentiles:**
   - **Data Distribution:** Percentiles are particularly useful for understanding data distribution. They divide the data into 100 equal parts, providing insights into how data points are spread out.
   - **Comparison:** Percentiles allow for easy comparison between different datasets or scores. For example, knowing that a test score is in the 90th percentile means it is better than 90% of the scores.
   - **Outliers:** Percentiles help in identifying outliers. Values in the very high or very low percentiles (e.g., above the 95th or below the 5th percentile) can be considered outliers.
   - **Consistency:** In datasets with a large number of values, percentiles give a more consistent measure of central tendency and variability compared to mean and standard deviation, especially in the presence of skewed data.

3. **Percentiles and Nature:**
   - **Natural Phenomena:** Percentiles can be used to analyze natural phenomena, such as rainfall, temperature, and seismic activity. For example, determining the 90th percentile of annual rainfall can help in understanding unusual weather patterns.
   - **Biological Studies:** In biology, percentiles are used to assess growth and development. For instance, a child's height in the 75th percentile means they are taller than 75% of children their age.
   - **Environmental Monitoring:** Environmental scientists use percentiles to track pollutant levels. The 95th percentile of pollutant concentration might be used to set regulatory standards.

### Explanation of Scores in a Single Percentile
Yes, many scores can fall within a single percentile, especially in data sets where values are repeated. This situation often occurs in discrete data sets or when there is a limited range of possible scores. Here's a detailed explanation:

**Percentile Ranges:**
- Percentiles divide data into 100 equal parts. Each percentile represents 1% of the data.
- In a large data set, each percentile typically contains multiple data points.
- When scores are repeated or clustered around certain values, multiple data points can occupy the same percentile range.

**Effect of Repeated Values:**
- In data sets with repeated values, many scores can fall within the same percentile. For example, if many students score 85 on a test, the percentile range containing the score of 85 will include all these students.
- The exact number of scores in a single percentile depends on the data distribution and the number of repeated values.

### Example Calculation

Consider a data set of 300 test scores. To find how many scores can fall within a single percentile, let's use the 80th percentile as an example.

1. **Sort the Data:**
   - Arrange the 300 test scores in ascending order.

2. **Calculate the Position:**
   - The position of the 80th percentile in a data set with 300 values is:
     $`
     \text{Position} = 0.80 \times (300 + 1) = 0.80 \times 301 = 240.8
     `$
   - This indicates the 240.8th value in the sorted list, which is between the 240th and 241st scores.

3. **Consider Repeated Values:**
   - If the 240th, 241st, and several other surrounding scores are the same (e.g., all scores of 85), they will all fall within the 80th percentile.
   - In this case, if the scores from the 240th to the 243rd positions are all 85, then all these scores are within the 80th percentile.

### Real-World Implications

**In Test Scores:**
- In standardized tests, it is common for many students to receive the same score. These scores can cluster within the same percentile range.
- For example, if 20 students score 85 on a test, and this score falls within the 80th percentile, all 20 students are considered within the same percentile.

**In Environmental Data:**
- When measuring pollutant levels, several measurements might be identical. If 10 days have the same pollutant level, they might all fall within the same percentile range.

### Summary

Yes, many scores can be in a single percentile, especially if there are repeated values or if the data set has a limited range of scores. The exact number of scores within a percentile depends on the distribution and repetition of the data points.

## Types of Distribution in Percentile
Percentile distributions themselves aren't categorized into types in the same way as statistical distributions. Instead, percentiles are a way of dividing data into 100 equal parts to understand relative standing. However, here’s an overview of some common ways percentiles can be interpreted based on different data distributions:

1. **Uniform Distribution**: If the data is uniformly distributed, each percentile will have an equal number of data points. For example, if you have a uniform distribution with 300 data points, each percentile will contain exactly 3 data points.

### what short of distribution it is -
A total of 10,000 people visited the shopping mall over 12 hours:

Time (hours)	People
0	0
2	350
4	1100
6	2400
8	6500
10	8850
12	10,000

The distribution described in your data is **right-skewed**. Here’s why:

- **Right-Skewed Distribution**: This means that the majority of the data points are clustered towards the lower end of the range, with a tail extending to the right (higher values). In your data, most people visit the mall towards the end of the 12-hour period. The number of people visiting increases significantly as time progresses, peaking at 10,000 people at 12 hours. The distribution shows a concentration of visitors towards the end, with fewer visitors early in the day.

Here’s a breakdown of the distribution:

- **Early Hours (0 to 6 hours)**: The number of visitors starts at 0 and increases slowly, with the highest number being 2400 at 6 hours.
- **Later Hours (8 to 12 hours)**: There is a sharp increase in the number of visitors as time progresses, reaching a peak at 12 hours. This indicates that more people visit the mall as it gets closer to closing time, leading to a longer tail on the right.

The rapid increase in the number of people visiting towards the end creates a right-skewed distribution.

2. **Normal Distribution**: For a normal distribution (bell curve), percentiles are calculated based on the standard deviation and mean. The data is clustered around the mean, so the percentiles are not evenly distributed. The 50th percentile (median) is at the mean, and the distribution of data points increases or decreases as you move away from the mean.

3. **Skewed Distribution**: In skewed distributions (either right-skewed or left-skewed), percentiles will be uneven. In a right-skewed distribution, more data points are concentrated in the lower percentiles, while in a left-skewed distribution, more data points are concentrated in the higher percentiles.

4. **Bimodal Distribution**: In a bimodal distribution, which has two peaks, percentiles may vary depending on which peak is dominant. The distribution of percentiles will reflect the presence of two distinct clusters of data.

5. **Exponential Distribution**: In an exponential distribution, which often models time until an event occurs, percentiles will be skewed such that lower percentiles have more data points compared to higher percentiles.

6. **Categorical Data Percentiles**: For categorical or ordinal data, percentiles may not be as meaningful because the data is not continuous. However, percentiles can still be used to understand the distribution of categories or ranks.

In summary, percentiles are a tool to understand the distribution of data but don’t themselves come in types. The type of distribution of the data determines how the percentiles are spread and interpreted.

### what kind of distribution it is-
300 students take test, got score from 15 to 75 range. score 15 got 10 stu, 16 got 20 stu, 20 got 40 stu, 30 got 70 stu, 40 got 120 stu, 75 got 40 students.

The distribution of test scores you’ve described is **bimodal**. Here’s why:

1. **Bimodal Distribution**: This type of distribution has two distinct peaks or modes. In your data, there are two clear peaks:
   - One peak at a score of 30 with 70 students.
   - Another peak at a score of 40 with 120 students.

2. **Data Points**:
   - 15: 10 students
   - 16: 20 students
   - 20: 40 students
   - 30: 70 students
   - 40: 120 students
   - 75: 40 students

   The distribution shows higher frequencies at scores of 30 and 40, which are significantly higher compared to the surrounding scores. The number of students drops off sharply on either side of these peaks.

3. **Characteristics**:
   - **Peaks**: There are two modes in the distribution: one at 30 and another at 40.
   - **Spread**: Scores of 15, 16, 20, and 75 show fewer students compared to the two peaks, contributing to the bimodal nature.

The distribution's shape suggests that there are two different groups or clusters of students scoring at different levels.

### To count 80 percentile of score
To find the 80th percentile of scores from your data, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Scores**: The scores are already sorted in ascending order:
   - 15: 10 students
   - 16: 20 students
   - 20: 40 students
   - 30: 70 students
   - 40: 120 students
   - 75: 40 students

2. **Calculate the Position of the 80th Percentile**:
   - Total number of students = 300
   - 80th percentile position = $` 0.80 \times 300 = 240 `$

   This means you need to find the score at the 240th position when all students are listed in ascending order.

3. **Determine the Score at the 240th Position**:
   - Students scoring 15: 10
   - Students scoring 16: 20 (cumulative = 30)
   - Students scoring 20: 40 (cumulative = 70)
   - Students scoring 30: 70 (cumulative = 140)
   - Students scoring 40: 120 (cumulative = 260)

   The cumulative count of students scoring 40 reaches 260, which covers the 240th position.

Thus, the 80th percentile of the scores is **40**.
